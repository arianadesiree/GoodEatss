# Bone-Apple-Teeth!

What I have created here is an interactive application using React, as well as Javscript, CSS, and HTML. I also used the API [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/). Bone-Apple-Teeth is an interactive site that allows you to search our catalog for international dishes you may try from all around the world. Just search for your poultry type, i.e. chicken, steak, and shrimp, and be amazed at the unique dishes that you can find. As you scroll over a dish, the recipe appears, as well as a link to watch a youtube video explaining how to make the dish.

### Users:
This recipe website will be typically used by someone in there late twenties, early forties, male or female who wants to try out new meals during there weeks. You can search anything on the application from quick meals to full on gourmet meals. You can search for recipes on this app and find all that you will need to spruce up your meals during the week.
